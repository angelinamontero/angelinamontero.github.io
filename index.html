  <p>
    Fashion is about expressing your identity, showing someone who you are
     through your fashion choices and using your clothes to tell someone something about you.
     Or at least it is for me- I suppose for some people clothing is just about comfort or utility
      but for me it's about expressing myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beauty, self-expression, self-confidence, progression

    These are four more words that can also be used to describe fashion and these four words,
    among many more, are the soul purpose why fashion has such a huge impact on many lives, including my own.

    <p>“We’re not about minimalism; we’re massimalismo,” Stefano Gabbana has said. Gabbana and Domenico Dolce have built a billion-dollar luxury business based on a cinematic dream of Sicily. While they’ve worked through a succession of movie-world muses—Anna Magnani, Sophia Loren, Monica Bellucci, Scarlett Johansson, Isabella Rossellini—their stylistic signatures have remained remarkably consistent over the years: tailoring, la bella figura, leopard print, lingerie, and lace, all leavened by an attitude of playful mischief.</p>
